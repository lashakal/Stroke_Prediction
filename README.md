# Stroke Prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide and the second leading cause of death. Over the last 17 years, the lifetime risk of developing a stroke has increased by 50% and now 1 in 4 people is estimated to have a stroke in their lifetime. In this project, we designed a stroke prediction model with a user-friendly interface that can assess an individualâ€™s risk of stroke based on their health data and medical history using a machine learning algorithm. The choice of this machine learning algorithm is based on multi-step testing and evaluation.

#### Objectives:
* Data visualization - utilize data visualization techniques to learn more about the dataset.
* Data preprocessing - prepare the dataset for the next steps - drop features that do not contribute meaningfully to the dataset; fill any missing values; encode string literals into integers to make applying machine learning algorithms to the dataset easier.
* Model development - Utilize 4 classification algorithms in total and develop predictive models using each.
* Model evaluation - evaluate each of the 4 classification models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and generate confusion matrices.
* Choose the best-performing algorithm to be the basis of the main predictive model.
* Develop a user-friendly interface - develop a user-friendly interface using the Streamlit framework that can interact with the user and display the results of the predictive model.
