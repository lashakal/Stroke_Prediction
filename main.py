Over the last 17years, the lifetime risk of developing a stroke has increased by 50% and now 1 in 4 people is estimated to have a stroke in their lifetime. In this project, we are aiming to design a stroke prediction model with a user-friendly interface that can assess an individualâ€™s risk of stroke based on their health data and medical history using the KNN classification algorithm.
